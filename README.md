# 🚗 Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC) — Team Autonomists

Welcome to the official repository of **Team Autonomists** for the **Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC)**.  
This repository will contain all software, documentation, and development work as we build and program an autonomous 1:10 scale vehicle for the competition.

## 🏁 About the Bosch Future Mobility Challenge (BFMC)

The **Bosch Future Mobility Challenge** is an international autonomous-driving competition organized by **Bosch Engineering Center Cluj**.  
University teams from around the world develop software for a 1:10 scale autonomous car capable of:

- Following lanes  
- Recognizing traffic signs  
- Navigating intersections  
- Avoiding obstacles  
- Performing parking maneuvers  
- Communicating with infrastructure (V2I)  

The challenge simulates real-world autonomous driving tasks, pushing teams to work on **perception**, **planning**, **control**, and **communication** systems.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

Since we are in the **initial stage**, this repository currently serves as:

- A starting point for our BFMC project  
- A place to document our progress and planning  
- A foundation for future modules and code  
- A collaborative workspace for Team Autonomists  

As development progresses, this repository will include:

- Perception modules (lane detection, traffic sign recognition)  
- Planning and decision-making algorithms  
- Control systems (PID/MPC)  
- Simulation environments  
- BFMC hardware integration
