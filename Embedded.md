This document provides a step-by-step guide to configuring your environment for the **Bosch Future Mobility Challenge** embedded platform.

---

## 📋 1. Preliminary Setup
Before you initiate the building process, ensure your environment is correctly configured. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All installations should use **Python 3.6+**. 
> Administrative privileges may be required for some steps.

### 🔧 Required Tools

| Tool | Purpose | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python 3.6+** | Scripting & Package Management | [Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) |
| **CMake** | Build Process Management | [Download](https://cmake.org/download/) |
| **GNU Arm Toolchain** | Cross-compiler for Nucleo-F401RE | [Download](https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/open-source-software/developer-tools/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads) |

## 💻 2. Installation Steps

### 🔹 Ninja & Mbed-tools
Ninja focuses on build speed, while `mbed-tools` is essential for managing the project structure. Run the following in your terminal:


# Install Ninja build system
pip install ninja

# Install Mbed-tools
pip install mbed-tools

# Install formatting tools for build output
pip install prettytable intelhex

## 🏗️ Building and Flashing

This module focuses on the transition from source code to hardware execution. It is a critical part of the **Embedded Platform** development workflow for the BFMC competition.

---

## 🧠 The Engineering Logic
Our build system is designed to be **cross-platform**. We use `mbed-tools` to compile high-level C++ code into a machine-readable `.bin` (binary) file specifically optimized for the **ARM Cortex-M4** architecture of the **Nucleo-F401RE**.

---

## 🛠️ Step 1: Building the Project
Based on the **MBED CLI 2** documentation, the `mbed-tools` command manages the build lifecycle. This ensures all dependencies are linked and the code is optimized for the microcontroller.

### Build Command
Run the following in your terminal to compile the code:

mbed-tools compile -m NUCLEO_F401RE -t GCC_ARM
